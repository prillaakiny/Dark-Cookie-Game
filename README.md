# Dark Cookie Game

Welcome to the Dark Cookie Game! 

Do you know the annoying cookie banners you receive when you want to access websites? Well, those cookie banners seek your permission to track all your activities online and often sell your personal information. It is possible to reject these cookies, but most times people don't know how.
